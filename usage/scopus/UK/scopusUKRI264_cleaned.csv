Human bone-marrow-derived stromal cells (hMSC) were obtained from the Imperial College Healthcare Tissue Bank (ICHTB, Human Tissue Authority licence 12275). ICHTB is supported by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre based at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London. ICHTB is approved by the UK National Research Ethics Service to release human material for research (12/WA/0196) as previously described51. The samples for this project were issued from subcollection R16052. Fifty-microlitre 5% hydrogels formed with 5-K PEG-4VS were formed in six-well plates and 24-mm Sigmacote-treated coverslips placed on top. After hydrogel formation, 5,000hMSCcm−2were seeded and allowed to adhere for 2h prior to the addition of basal culture medium. After 24h, hMSC were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and stained with phalloidin–tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (Sigma) and DAPI. Cells were imaged on an Olympus inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a Jenoptik camera.

HCSS/HSpot/HIPE are joint developments by the Herschel Science Ground Segment Consortium, consisting of ESA, NASA Herschel Science Center, and HIFI, PACS and SPIRE consortia. SPIRE has been developed by a consortium of institutes led by Cardiff University (UK) and including University of Lethbridge (Canada); NAOC (China); CEA, LAM (France); IFSI, University of Padua (Italy); IAC (Spain); Stockholm Observatory (Sweden); Imperial College London, RAL, UCL-MSSL, UKATC, University 2 http://hedam.lam.fr/HerMES/index/dr4 3 Data products will be made publicly available at the end of HELP in December 2017; however, early access can be granted on request. of Sussex (UK); and Caltech, JPL, NHSC, University of Colorado (USA). This development has been supported by national funding agencies: CSA (Canada); NAOC (China); CEA, CNES, CNRS (France); ASI (Italy); MCINN (Spain); SNSB(Sweden); STFC, UKSA (UK); and NASA (USA). This research has made use of data from HerMES project (http://hermes.sussex.ac.uk/). HerMES is a Herschel Key Programme utilizing Guaranteed Time from the SPIRE instrument team, ESAC scientists and a mission scientist. The HerMES data were accessed through the Herschel Database in Marseille (HeDaM-http://hedam.lam.fr) operated by CeSAM and hosted by the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille. This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA. Special thanks goes to Yannick Roehlly for organization of code, and LouiseWinters for management within HELP. This paper make use of MATPLOTLIB (Hunter 2007) and ASTROPY, a communitydeveloped core PYTHON package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013).
