	<h1>Welcome to Rosetta Stan</h1>
	<p>Rosetta Stan plays a similar role to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> in that it shows different ways to build statistical models in common frameworks/languages. Like the our inspiration, the site is driven by examples leaving it to the reader to sort out the translation. The Stan environment is the common element across all the `translations`. 
	</p>
	<p>We welcome external contributions. The repo is at <a href="https://github.com/rosetta-stan/rosetta-stan.github.io">https://github.com/rosetta-stan/rosetta-stan.github.io</a> where contributions can be made or you can reach out to Breck at <a href="mailto:fbb2116@columbia.edu">fbb2116@columbia.edu</a>
